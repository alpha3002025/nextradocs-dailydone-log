Inspired by the [Vue.js official documentation](https://vuejs.org/), Green Nextra is a sleek markdown editor and blog platform designed for developer productivity.

## Features

### Local Editor
Manage your content directly on `localhost`. You can create, delete, and modify markdown files, as well as organize categories seamlessly. The editor supports four powerful modes to suit your workflow:

- **Live Mode**: A WYSIWYG-like experience where your content is rendered as markdown in real-time.
- **Preview Mode**: Focus entirely on reviewing the final rendered output.
- **Source Mode**: Edit the raw markdown source code without distractions.
- **Both Mode**: A split-screen view showing the editor and the preview side-by-side.

### Read-Only Production
When deployed to production environments like Vercel or GitHub Pages, the application automatically switches to a secure **Read-Only Mode**, giving visitors a seamless reading experience for your written content.
